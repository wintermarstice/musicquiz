# (WORK IN PROGRESS) musicquiz

A music guessing game made in Rust :crab: and a reincarnation of the game of the same name.

# Note - help needed
As I'm new to this language I have a lot to wrap my head around, so best practices and refactoring efforts are appreciated in advance.

# Thanks and greetings to
